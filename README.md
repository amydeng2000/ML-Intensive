# minSkLearn
A mini ML library written with Numpy.
- Micrograd & Neural Net layer on top
- Linear Regression
  - Linear regression with gradient descent
  - Linear regression using least squares formula to calculate weights
  - Linear regression + Lasso regularization with gradient descent
  - Linear regression + Ridge regularization with gradient descent
- Logistic Regression
- K Means Clustering
- K Nearest Neighbors
  - For classification
  - For regression
- [WIP] Convolutional Neural Network

This ML intensive is a part of my meta-learning experiment: [www.metalearn.substack.com](https://metalearn.substack.com/)
